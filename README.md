Create visualizations that convey a compelling story.
I took the spotify dataset from KAGGLE and from the data i visualized the TOP 10 TRACK streamed by the user, TOP 10 ARTIST of all time. Accordingly , TOP MONTHLY ARTIST was visualized to find who was the most listened artist in a particular month. The regional analysis shows insights on the number of streams from a particular place , with the STREAMS OVER TIME showing overall changes in the top 10 most streamed artist.
